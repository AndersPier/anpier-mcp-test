# MCP (Model-Controller-Presenter) Architecture

## Overview

MCP (Model-Controller-Presenter) is an architectural pattern derived from MVC (Model-View-Controller) that aims to improve separation of concerns and testability in software applications. This repository serves as a demonstration of MCP principles.

## Core Components

### Model
- Represents the application's data and business logic
- Responsible for data validation, storage, and retrieval
- Independent of the user interface
- Notifies the Presenter of state changes

### Controller
- Handles user input and translates it into actions for the Model or Presenter
- Routes commands from the UI to the appropriate components
- Manages application flow and navigation
- Typically lightweight, focusing on coordination rather than business logic

### Presenter
- Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View
- Prepares data from the Model for display in the View
- Updates the View when the Model changes
- Contains presentation logic but not business logic

## Key Differences from MVC

| MVC | MCP |
|-----|-----|
| View has direct access to Model | View has no direct access to Model |
| Controller focuses on input handling | Controller handles navigation and flow |
| View updates itself based on Model changes | Presenter updates the View based on Model changes |

## Benefits of MCP

1. **Enhanced Testability**: By decoupling the View from the Model, unit testing becomes easier
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component have minimal impact on others
4. **Reusability**: Components can be more easily reused across different parts of the application
5. **Flexibility**: The architecture adapts well to both simple and complex applications

## Implementation Considerations

- For simple applications, MCP might introduce unnecessary complexity
- The Presenter can become bloated if not carefully managed
- Requires clear conventions for communication between components
- Works best with a binding mechanism or event system for updates

## Example Flow

1. User interacts with the View
2. View forwards the action to the Controller
3. Controller processes the input and calls appropriate Model methods
4. Model updates its state and notifies the Presenter
5. Presenter retrieves data from the Model and formats it for display
6. Presenter updates the View with the formatted data

# Note on MCP Terminology

MCP can also refer to "Model Context Protocol," a different concept used in AI integration. The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations.

## Top Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

If you're looking for Model Context Protocol servers for AI integration, here are some of the best options:

1. **Elasticsearch MCP Server** - Provides Elasticsearch interaction for AI models, enabling semantic search and data retrieval capabilities.

2. **MongoDB Lens** - A full-featured MCP server for MongoDB databases, allowing AI models to query and analyze MongoDB collections with natural language.

3. **ElevenLabs Integration** - A server that connects with ElevenLabs text-to-speech API for generating voiceovers with multiple voices.

4. **Reasoning Engine** - Helps LLMs manage reasoning, task management, and organization to improve problem-solving capabilities.

5. **Java SDK** - Enables seamless integration between Java and Spring applications and MCP-compliant AI models and tools.

6. **SpaceX API Connector** - Provides real-time information about SpaceX launches and missions, demonstrating how MCP can connect to external data sources.

7. **MySQL** - MySQL database integration with configurable access controls and schema inspection.

These servers follow the Model Context Protocol architecture which:
- Enhances AI context awareness by enabling two-way communication
- Allows models to access real-time information and perform actions
- Grounds AI responses in accurate, up-to-date data
- Simplifies integration compared to traditional APIs
