# MCP (Model-Controller-Presenter) Architecture

## Overview

MCP (Model-Controller-Presenter) is an architectural pattern derived from MVC (Model-View-Controller) that aims to improve separation of concerns and testability in software applications. This repository serves as a demonstration of MCP principles.

## Core Components

### Model
- Represents the application's data and business logic
- Responsible for data validation, storage, and retrieval
- Independent of the user interface
- Notifies the Presenter of state changes

### Controller
- Handles user input and translates it into actions for the Model or Presenter
- Routes commands from the UI to the appropriate components
- Manages application flow and navigation
- Typically lightweight, focusing on coordination rather than business logic

### Presenter
- Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View
- Prepares data from the Model for display in the View
- Updates the View when the Model changes
- Contains presentation logic but not business logic

## Key Differences from MVC

| MVC | MCP |
|-----|-----|
| View has direct access to Model | View has no direct access to Model |
| Controller focuses on input handling | Controller handles navigation and flow |
| View updates itself based on Model changes | Presenter updates the View based on Model changes |

## Benefits of MCP

1. **Enhanced Testability**: By decoupling the View from the Model, unit testing becomes easier
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component have minimal impact on others
4. **Reusability**: Components can be more easily reused across different parts of the application
5. **Flexibility**: The architecture adapts well to both simple and complex applications

## Implementation Considerations

- For simple applications, MCP might introduce unnecessary complexity
- The Presenter can become bloated if not carefully managed
- Requires clear conventions for communication between components
- Works best with a binding mechanism or event system for updates

## Example Flow

1. User interacts with the View
2. View forwards the action to the Controller
3. Controller processes the input and calls appropriate Model methods
4. Model updates its state and notifies the Presenter
5. Presenter retrieves data from the Model and formats it for display
6. Presenter updates the View with the formatted data
